The fastest, lightest, and most faithful Discord HTML transcript generator. Built exclusively for the Bun ecosystem.

Stop simulating browsers to generate simple text logs. Buncord-Transcript purges the bloat of JSDOM and React, replacing them with a high-performance, string-based rendering engine powered by Bun and a specialized fork of Mustache.

### **⚡ Performance Tier 1**

`Zero Node Dependencies: No ws, no http legacy, no JSDOM. Pure Bun-native speed.`

`Mustache Powered: Generates complex transcripts in milliseconds using optimized string templates instead of heavy DOM manipulation.`

`Memory Footprint: Practically zero. While others eat hundreds of MBs to "render", Buncord stays invisible in your RAM.`

### **🎨 Absolute Cinema UI**

`True Discord v2 Support: Perfect rendering for the latest components: Buttons, Select Menus, and the new Containers.`

`CSS Variable Logic: Unlike other libraries with hardcoded values, Buncord uses a dynamic CSS variable system mirrored from the official Discord client for 1:1 visual fidelity.`

`Media Gallery Integration: Native support for multi-image attachments and high-res avatars.`

### **📦 Installation**
code Bash
```bash
bun add github:LuigiColantuono/buncord-transcript
```

### **🛠️ The Philosophy**

Built out of frustration with outdated, bloated libraries that fail to render modern Discord components. This is a "Level 1" tool for developers who prioritize performance and code purity.

**To install dependencies:**
